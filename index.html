            <p>Hello there, <br>
                I'm Litralson Eluvathingal (he/him), the first of his name, and I rather not discuss its meaning.
                 I graduated from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru with a Bachelor's and Master's in Biology (BS-MS), 
                 which is a research-oriented interdisciplinary program. During this period, my research focus was on cell biology, exploring how organelle morphology 
                 changes in different physiological conditions and how receptor protein distribution affects signalling dynamics, with the help of super-resolution 
                 microscopy. I'm currently interested in emergent properties in 
                 biological systems like pattern formation (Reaction-Diffusion systems), collective behaviour, and cellular intelligence.
                  <br> <br>
                 As a natural extension of my interest in emergent properties in biological systems, Iâ€™m also fascinated by the bottom-up approach to 
                 designing systems where the individual interacting components are designed and their interactions give rise to properties 
                 of the system. I do realise the inherent limitation of these systems of optimising for local conditions 
                 but they are fascinating nonetheless. The transition from local to global optimisation in these systems is something
                 that I would like to explore further. In my free time, I enjoy reading books and photographing life around me (mostly insects and occasionally humans). 
                 I also appreciate well-thought-out designs, whether in information design, architecture, institutional structure,
                 or consumer products.

                <li><b>Slime Mold (<i>Physarum polycephalum</i>): Emergent Networks for Urban Planning</b> <br>
                    Keywords:<i> Physics of Life, Physarum polycephalum, Emergent Properties, & Urban Planning.</i> <br>
                     Through this project, I tried to replicate the work of  <i> A. Tero et al 2010 </i> where showed 
                     the networks formed by slime molds are similar in efficiency, cost, and fault tolerance
                     to that of the Tokyo rail network. Here I wanted to see how slime mold optimises the 
                     connections between the proposed Namma Metro and Suburban stations in Bengaluru. 
                     This was developed with <u><b><a href="https://www.icts.res.in/event/sci560">TIFR-ICTS </a></b></u>for 
                     the Sci560 exhibition season at Science Gallery Bengaluru (SGB).</li> <br>

                <li><b> Autophagy: Simulating the Autophagosome Biogenesis</b>  <br>  
                    Keywords: <i>Biophysics, Autophagy, & Molecular Dynamics Simulations.</i> <br>                                      
                     We worked on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of phagophore membranes with embedded LC3
                     proteins that aimed to improve our understanding of macroautophagy. This process 
                     helps to remove waste materials from cells. Through this project, we tried to decipher 
                     the curvature-generating effects of LC3 proteins on Endoplasmic reticulum membranes. 
                     The LC3 protein being investigated here gets embedded in the membrane after it gets 
                     conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) residue. The LC3 protein-PE complex can
                     be thought of as a lipid with a huge head group and the clustering of them could 
                     potentially result in the altering of the curvature of the membrane due to steric effects. <br>

                    Keywords: <i>Monte Carlo Simulations, Cell Blender, M Cell, Reaction Diffusion Systems, Cell Biology, & Super-resolution Microscopy.</i> <br>
                    I used Super-Resolution Microscopy (STORM) to map out the Notch-1 
                    distribution on a cell membrane and quantified its properties.  
                    Then we simulated the Notch-1 distribution on a cell membrane
                     using a reaction-diffusion model and
                    analysed how that affected the signalling dynamics.  </li> <br>
                <li><b> Mitochondrial Dynamics: Nanoscale Mapping of Mitochondrial Topography in Heterologous Cell Lines</b> <br>
                    Keywords: <i>SRRF, Super-resolution Microscopy, Mitochondrial fission and fusion, Image processing, & CRISPRi</i> <br>
                    Quantifying mitochondrial volume in Neuro-2a cells using Super-resolution microscopy (SRRF) and 3-D rendering at different 
                    levels of expression of SIRT3. At different expression levels of SIRT3, we observed differences 
                    in the distribution of the amount of punctate, intermediate, and filamentous mitochondria. 
                    This project involved designing primers, plasmid cloning, CRISPRi, plasmid transfection,
                    immunocytochemistry, and image processing.

                        Keratinocytes, Image processing, & 3D Rendering</i> <br>
                        Through this project, we investigated the role of the Golgi apparatus in the maturation of specialised lysosomes in 
                        differentiated keratinocytes. I was involved in image acquisition and 3D rendering of organelles to observe whether 
                        there was any contact between these organelles and later to see the extent of these contacts. This involved using 
                        microscopy techniques like SRRF (Super Resolution and Radial Fluctuations) and SIM (Structured Illumination Microscopy).<br>
