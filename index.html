            <p>Hello There, <br>
                I'm Litralson (he/him), the first of his name, as far as I know, and please don't ask me its meaning.
                 I graduated from the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru with a Bachelor's and Master's in Biology (BS-MS), 
                 which was a research-oriented interdisciplinary program. I'm currently interested in emergent properties in 
                 biological systems like pattern formation (Reaction-Diffusion systems), collective behaviour,  intelligence, 
                 and the origin of life. I like photographing life around me (mostly insects and occasionally humans). 
                 I also appreciate well-thought-out designs, whether in information design, architecture, institutional structure,
                 or consumer products. <br> <br>
                 As a natural extension of my interest in emergent properties, Iâ€™m also fascinated by the bottom-up approach to 
                 designing systems where the individual interacting components are designed and their interactions give rise to properties 
                 of the system. I do realise the inherent limitation of these systems of optimising for local parameter values 
                 but they are fascinating nonetheless. The transition from local to global optimisation in these systems is something
                 that I would like to explore further.

            <ul>
                <li><b>Emergent Slime Mold Networks for Urban Planning:</b>
                    Through this project, I tried to replicate the work of <i> A. Tero et al 2010 </i>
                    where they showed the networks formed by slime molds (<i>Physarum polycephalum</i>) 
                    are similar in efficiency, cost, and 
                    fault tolerance to that of the Tokyo rail network in the context of Bengaluru. 
                    This was developed with <u><a href="https://www.icts.res.in/event/sci560">TIFR-ICTS </a></u>for the Sci560 exhibition season at Science Gallery Bengaluru.</li>

                <li><b>Biophysics & Molecular Dynamics Simulations:</b>                                          
                    I worked on large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of 
                    protein-membrane systems that aimed to improve our understanding 
                    of macroautophagy, a process that helps to remove waste 
                    materials from cells.</li>
                <li><b>Simulations, Cell Biology, & Super-resolution Microscopy:</b>   
                     I used 
                    Super-Resolution Microscopy (STORM) to map out the Notch-1 
                    distribution on a cell membrane and quantified its properties.  
                    Then we simulated the Notch-1 distribution on a cell membrane
                     using a reaction-diffusion model and
                    analysed how that affected the signalling dynamics.  </li>
